# Car-Number-Plates-Detection
Welcome to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system project! This repository contains code and resources for detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates from live video feeds using computer vision techniques. The project leverages OpenCV for image processing and Haar Cascades for number plate detection.

# Overview
The ANPR system is designed to automatically detect and read vehicle number plates from a live video stream captured via a webcam. This can be useful in various applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and security enforcement.

# Key Features
Real-Time Detection: The system captures video from a webcam and processes each frame in real-time to detect number plates.
Haar Cascades: Utilizes pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers for robust and efficient number plate detection.
Image Processing: Employs various image processing techniques to enhance the accuracy of detection.
Extendable: The project can be extended to include Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for reading the text on the detected number plates.

# How It Works
Capture Video: The system captures video frames from a webcam.
Convert to Grayscale: Each frame is converted to grayscale to simplify processing.
Detect Plates: Haar Cascade classifiers are used to detect number plates in the grayscale image.
Draw Bounding Boxes: Rectangles are drawn around detected number plates for visualization.
Display Results: The processed frames with detected plates are displayed in real-time.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

# Installation

# Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/anpr-system.git

# Future Enhancements
OCR Integration: Integrate Tesseract or another OCR library to read and display the text on detected number plates.
Database Storage: Store detected number plate information in a database for further analysis and record-keeping.
Performance Optimization: Improve the detection algorithm for faster processing and higher accuracy.
